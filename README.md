📊 Tableau Vehicle Trends Analysis
📌 Overview

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes total vehicle trends by model year. It focuses on identifying growth patterns over time using aggregated measures and reference lines, helping convert raw data into meaningful visual insights.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to practice data analysis and visualization using Tableau by building a structured dashboard. It emphasizes correct aggregation, handling data type issues, and interpreting trends through visual analytics.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains vehicle-related data categorized by model year and vehicle type, including total vehicles and subcategories. The dataset used is publicly available and intended solely for learning and analysis purposes.

🛠 Tools Used

O. Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public

O. Microsoft Excel (data inspection)

O. GitHub (documentation)

📈 Dashboard Features
